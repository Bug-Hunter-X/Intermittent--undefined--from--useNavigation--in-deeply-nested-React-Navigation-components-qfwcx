This bug occurs when using React Navigation's `useNavigation` hook within a functional component that's deeply nested within other components, especially if those parent components also use context providers or other state management solutions. The issue manifests as `undefined` being returned by `useNavigation`, even though the component is clearly within the navigation container's scope.  The problem isn't immediately apparent because it might work correctly in some instances but fail inconsistently in others, often without clear error messages.  

```javascript
// Buggy Component
function DeeplyNestedScreen() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  console.log(navigation); // Might be undefined sometimes
  // ...
}
```
